inventory app for warehouses

make a venv folder to install flask inside because if this is not done it will not open the file
python3 -m venv venv

activate the virtual environment before installing flask
source venv/bin/activate

install flask (make sure you are inside the inventoryApp folder)
pip install flask

run the app
python3 app.py

it will say what ip address is the app running from
(example)

http://127.0.0.1:5000
or in localhost
